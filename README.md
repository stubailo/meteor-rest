# REST for Meteor

A set of packages that makes it easy to make your Meteor app's data accessible over HTTP. Easily integrate your Meteor backend into a native mobile app or query your data from your Rails or PHP app.

## Packages

- [simple:rest](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/blob/master/packages/rest/README.md) - just add the package, and all of your Meteor methods and publications will become accessible over HTTP.
- [simple:rest-accounts-password](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/blob/master/packages/rest-accounts-password/README.md) - add this package to enable password login over HTTP.
- [simple:json-routes](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/tree/master/packages/json-routes) - the simplest way to define a server-side route in your Meteor app, with no external dependencies.

## Planned

- `simple:rest-accounts-facebook`, etc - OAuth login packages for HTTP
- Static file management, authentication
- Integration with [Restivus](https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus) for custom API needs

## Contributing

1. Don't bump the version of the package in your PR - I'll do it myself :)
2. Please split up unrelated changes into different PRs, so that they can be
discussed independently.
